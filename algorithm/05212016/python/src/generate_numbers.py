"""
1. write a program that write to a file: each line has 5 fields, fields are separate by comma, each field is a random int [-9999, 9999], there are total of 5k lines
2. Write a program that takes 3 command line arguments m, n, p, the program will print out a list of up to p numbers from the previously generated file, each number satisfy the following:
The up/down/left/right neighbors are either all positive or all negative, 0 is neither positive nor negative
Must appear at least 50 times in column m if it is positive
Can’t appear more than 10 times in column n if it is negative
The number can't be in [-50, 50]
If there are more than p numbers satisfying these, only print the first p numbers, print “not exist” if there are no such numbers
3. Write a program that finds out what m and n values will maximize the number of unique numbers meeting requirements a)-d)
